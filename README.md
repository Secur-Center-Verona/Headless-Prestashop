# Headless Prestashop

A headless middleware that uses Prestashop database and backoffice while supporting .NET MVC and API front-office.

## Advantages

- Extremely fast
- Full control of the front-office UI and structure, allows you to build an API and consume it on a front-office developed using modern technologies like Vuejs, React or Blazor
- Side-by-side compatibility with Prestashop's front-office
